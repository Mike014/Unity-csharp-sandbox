# unity-csharp-sandbox

A hands-on C# learning journey through Unity, exploring scripting fundamentals, UI systems, and graphics — with a focus on code and Scripting API documentation.

## About

This repository documents my progress learning C# through game development with Unity, following the book *"Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity"*. The emphasis here is on understanding the **C# language** and Unity's **Scripting API** rather than building complete games.

## What You'll Find

- **Code Experiments** — Small, focused scripts exploring specific C# concepts
- **API Explorations** — Practical examples using Unity's Scripting API
- **UI Systems** — Working with Canvas, buttons, text, and event systems
- **Graphics & Rendering** — Shaders, materials, and visual scripting tests
- **Documentation** — Notes and comments explaining the *why* behind the code

## Topics Covered

### C# Fundamentals
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if/else, switch, loops)
- Methods and parameters
- Classes, objects, and inheritance
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Collections (arrays, lists, dictionaries)
- Events and delegates

### Unity Scripting API
- MonoBehaviour lifecycle (`Awake`, `Start`, `Update`, `FixedUpdate`)
- Input handling (`Input`, `InputSystem`)
- Physics (`Rigidbody`, `Collider`, raycasting)
- Coroutines and async patterns
- ScriptableObjects

### UI (UnityEngine.UI)
- Canvas and render modes
- Text, Image, Button components
- Event System and UI events
- Layout groups and anchoring
- TextMeshPro integration

### Graphics
- Materials and shaders basics
- Sprite rendering
- Camera manipulation
- Lighting fundamentals
